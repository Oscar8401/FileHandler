//JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.

//JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

//JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.

//Exchanging Data
//When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.

//JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.

//We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.

//This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.
